Query timeout issues can significantly impact application performance. To address this, start by optimizing your queries to ensure they are efficient and utilize indexes effectively. Use MongoDBâ€™s explain feature to analyze query execution plans and identify bottlenecks. Adjust the maxTimeMS parameter to set appropriate timeout values for queries. Ensure the database server has sufficient CPU and memory resources to handle query loads, and consider scaling resources if necessary. Regularly update statistics on collections to help the query optimizer. Also, monitor long-running operations and investigate their causes.
