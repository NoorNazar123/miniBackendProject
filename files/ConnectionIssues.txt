Connection issues in MongoDB can stem from various sources. First, check network configurations to ensure that there are no firewall or network routing issues preventing connectivity. Next, verify that the MongoDB server is running and accessible. Confirm that the correct hostnames and port numbers are being used. Ensure proper authentication credentials by double-checking usernames and passwords. Additionally, review the MongoDB server logs for any error messages that might indicate connection problems. If using a cloud service, ensure that the IP whitelist is correctly configured. Also, check for any issues with DNS resolution that might be affecting connectivity.
