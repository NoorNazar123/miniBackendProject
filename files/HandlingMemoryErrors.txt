Memory errors in MongoDB often indicate resource constraints. Begin by configuring memory limits in your MongoDB configuration file to ensure the server operates within safe limits. Use monitoring tools to keep an eye on memory usage trends. Optimize queries to reduce their memory footprint, and ensure that collections are properly indexed to speed up query performance. Regularly review and remove unused indexes to free up memory. Consider implementing pagination or batching for large query results to manage memory usage more effectively. Also, evaluate your schema design to ensure itâ€™s efficient and not consuming excessive memory.
